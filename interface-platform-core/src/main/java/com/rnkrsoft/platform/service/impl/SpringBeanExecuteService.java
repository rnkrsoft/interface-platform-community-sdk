 * as modifying the License.
 * <p/>
 * You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 * may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 * for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 * for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

 * whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 * unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 * negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 * liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

 * other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 * has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 * <p/>
