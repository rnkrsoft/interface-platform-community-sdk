 * by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 * Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 * with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 * institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 * cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 * or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 * or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 * granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

 * do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 * notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 * or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 * that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 * as modifying the License.
 * <p/>
 * You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 * may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 * for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 * for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 * reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

 * risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 * <p/>
 * 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 * whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 * unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 * negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 * liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 * incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 * result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 * Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 * work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 * other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 * has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 * <p/>
 * 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 * the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 * and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 * or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

 * defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 * incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 * of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
